# Deep Learning Alphabet Soup Foundation Analysis


## Results
•	Data Preprocessing

o	Target variable for the model is successful.

o	Features variable for the model is successful.

o	What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
	EIN AND NAME columns and EIN column was dropped for the optimized analysis.

###	Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
o	How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

o	Were you able to achieve the target model performance? In the first analysis when EIN and NAME columns were dropped, the model accuracy is 73% and the optimization analysis model accuracy is 79%
